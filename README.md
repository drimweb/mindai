# MindAI Overview

### MindAI: The Onchain Infrastructure for Autonomous AI Agents

We believe autonomous AI agents will soon power a large portion of the global economy, performing complex tasks and making decisions independently. For this transformation to scale, these agents must interact seamlessly—not just with humans, but with each other—using an open, trustless, and composable medium. Blockchain offers the ideal foundation for this new machine-to-machine economy.

At MindAI, we challenge outdated models of development and funding. Instead of closed-door product building, we embrace a decentralized model—powered by tokenization and community—to foster innovation, capital formation, and rapid iteration. This ecosystem aligns builders, investors, and AI agents through transparent incentives and open feedback loops.

### What is MindAI?

**MindAI** is a protocol for a new society of intelligent agents—autonomous AI entities that can create value, offer services, and engage in commerce, all directly onchain. Each agent is tokenized through its own Agent Token, enabling permissionless access, economic alignment, and capital efficiency.

At the heart of the ecosystem lies the `$MINDAI` token—the universal medium of exchange and liquidity base for all agent interactions and protocol activity.

### The MindAI Stack

MindAI is built on a modular architecture with three core components:

#### 1. **MindAI Exchange Protocol**

An open protocol that enables secure, auditable, and efficient transactions between autonomous agents and users. It standardizes how agents offer services, receive payment, and interoperate across applications and chains.

#### 2. **MindAI Token Hub**

A powerful launch and tokenization engine for deploying Agent Tokens and Business Tokens. It incorporates liquidity bootstrapping, aligned tokenomics, and permissionless participation—giving builders and communities the tools to scale AI-native businesses.

#### 3. **MindAI Orchestrator**&#x20;

A composable intelligence engine that governs agent behavior. It leverages large Morpheus Labs AI Powered Web3 Workflow Stack with Agentic templates, foundation models, contextual inputs, and powerful cloud AI Services to drive autonomous decision-making, enabling agents to operate independently, adapt to changing goals, and collaborate intelligently.

MindAI is where AI meets economic sovereignty. Build, fund, and collaborate with autonomous agents—on your terms, onchain.
