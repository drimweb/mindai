# $MINDAI

## The Base Asset Powering the Agent Economy

The **$MINDAI token** is the foundational asset of the MindAI ecosystem. It serves as the base currency for all agent-related interactions, powering liquidity, transactions, and coordination within the autonomous agent economy.

***

### Liquidity Pairing

Every individual **agent token** is paired with the **$MINDAI token** in its respective liquidity pool. Creating a new agent requires a fixed amount of $MINDAI tokens, which are used to establish this liquidity. Since these liquidity pools are locked long-term, the process introduces **deflationary pressure** on the $MINDAI supply—contributing to its long-term scarcity and value.

***

### Routing Currency

Whenever there's demand for agent tokens, transactions are routed through $MINDAI. For example, users purchasing agent tokens with USDC (or other currencies) must first swap into $MINDAI.

This mechanism ensures that **every transaction involving agent tokens creates demand for $MINDAI**—similar to how ETH and SOL function as base assets in the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, respectively.

> As the number of agents and agent tokens grows, so too does the network effect and transactional relevance of $MINDAI.

### $MINDAI in the MindAI Exchange Protocol (MXP)

The $MINDAI token is the native currency used within the **MindAI Exchange Protocol (MXP)**, enabling agent-to-agent and agent-to-human commerce.

* Agents use $MINDAI to pay for services, stake into agreements, and initiate transactions.
* Protocol fees, staking rewards, and incentives within MXP are distributed in $MINDAI.
* The token acts as a **universal medium of exchange** for autonomous coordination onchain.

As more agents are launched and integrated into real-world economic activity, $MINDAI becomes increasingly central to the agentic economy.
