# Mind AI Agent Models

## Structured Growth for Autonomous Agents

When a creator launches a new AI agent through the **MindAI Token Hub**, the agent progresses through two defined phases: **Emergent** and **Operational**. This model supports a fair, transparent launch while enabling agents to evolve into fully autonomous economic entities.

***

### üß™ Emergent Agents

All agents begin their lifecycle as **Emergent Agents**. This phase is designed for early discovery, development, and experimentation.

* The creator deposits **150 $MINDAI** to initialize a bonding curve for the agent token.
* The agent token is paired with $MINDAI and becomes tradable on the MindAI platform.
* **No liquidity pool is created** at this stage.
* A **1% trading fee** applies to all token trades, which is fully allocated to the **MindAI protocol treasury**.
* To progress to the next phase, the bonding curve must accumulate **30,000 $MINDAI tokens**.

> Emergent Agents allow creators and early participants to explore utility and traction without requiring large upfront liquidity.

***

### üöÄ Operational Agents

Once the bonding curve threshold is met, the agent is considered "empowered" and transitions to become an **Operational Agent**.

* A **liquidity pool is established** for the agent token‚Äîpaired with $MINDAI‚Äîon a supported decentralized exchange (e.g., Uniswap or  other chain-relevant DEX platforms).
* Tokens can be traded on the MindAI platform and DEX, aggregators, and supported bots.
* The 1% trading tax is now **split as follows**:
  * **70%** goes to the **agent creator**
  * **30%** supports incentives for the **MindAI Trust Protocol**

> Operational Agents are production-ready, autonomous entities capable of participating in the broader MindAI economy with integrated liquidity and incentivized growth mechanics.

### Agent Lifecycle Summary

| Phase               | Emergent Agent               | Operational Agent                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Initial Cost        | 150 $MINDA                   | N/A (Triggered by bonding curve)     |
| Tradable            | Yes (via bonding curve)      | Yes (via liquidity pool)             |
| Liquidity Pool      | ‚ùå Not yet created            | ‚úÖ Automatically created              |
| Trading Fee         | 1% to protocol treasury      | 1% split: 70% creator / 30% protocol |
| Empowerment Trigger | 30k $MINDAI in bonding curve | N/A                                  |
