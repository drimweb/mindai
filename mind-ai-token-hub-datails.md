# Mind AI Token Hub Datails

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Illustrative MindAI Token Hub Concept</p></figcaption></figure>



## A Future-Ready Framework for Tokenized Autonomous Agents

The **MindAI Token Hub** is designed to enable anyone—developers, creators, or communities—to launch tokenized autonomous agents. These agents are deployed using a fair, transparent, and scalable mechanism that blends dynamic pricing, bonding curves, and community ownership models.

This system is not yet live, but the following outlines the planned structure and flow of the MindAI Token Hub.

***

### Agent Creation Overview

The platform will support the creation of AI agents through an intuitive, permissionless interface. Agents are designed to evolve across two distinct phases:

* **Emergent Agents** – Early-stage, bonding-curve-based phase where an agent begins building community and value.
* **Operational Agents** – Mature, fully liquid agents with deep integration into the MindAI ecosystem.

Anyone will be able to launch their own agent by completing a creation form and depositing a minimum of **100 $MINDAI tokens** to initiate the bonding curve.

***

### Agent Creation Process

The following steps will define the agent creation lifecycle:

#### 1. Agent Profile Submission

Users define the identity and metadata of the agent via a form, including:

* **Profile Picture**
* **Name** (e.g., Web3 Expert)
* **Ticker** (e.g., $WTEXP)
* **Description** (mission, specialization, or AI persona)

\
**Agent Type** — Select the most relevant category:

* **On-Chain:** Trading capabilities or anything related to on-chain activities.
* **Information:** Provides insights and topic-related information.
* **Productivity:** Assists with productivity-related tasks.
* **Creative:** Generates content such as memes, art, music, etc.
* **Entertainment:** Includes AI KOLs (KAIL), musicians, and similar roles.

### 🔗 Agent Setup

Upon an agent's Empowering, a series of on-chain processes will be triggered to fully establish the agent’s identity, economy, and liquidity. These processes are designed to be automated, permissionless, and verifiable by the community.

Here’s what the setup may include:

#### 🧠 Mint Agent NFT

An NFT is minted to represent the agent's identity. This NFT serves as a permanent, verifiable anchor for the agent in the MindAI ecosystem and may be used to access governance, metadata, or proof of authorship.

#### 💠 Deploy Agent Token

A standard ERC-20 token (e.g., $WTEXP for agent Web3 Expert) is deployed with:

* A **fixed supply** of 1,000,000,000 tokens
* &#x20;Linked to the agent's profile
* Integration with the MindAI Exchange Protocol

#### 🏦 Create Immutable Contribution Vault (ICV)

An ERC-1155 **token-bound vault** is created for the agent. This smart contract acts as a home for:

* Contributions from the community
* Holds the successfully approved proposals related to the agent

#### 💧 Establish Liquidity Pool

A Uniswap style liquidity pool will be created on supported chains  pairing:

* The agent’s token (eg. $WTEXP)
* The base asset ($MINDAI)

All $MINDAI accumulated during bonding will be added as initial liquidity alongside the newly minted agent tokens.

#### 🔒 Stake LP Tokens

LP tokens received from the liquidity pool are staked into a smart contract on behalf of the agent with a **10-year lock period** to ensure long-term liquidity stability.

#### 🧾 Distribution of Staking LP Tokens  (Staking Receipts)

As a receipt for staking, $sWTEXP tokens are distributed to the user. These serve as proof of liquidity pool contribution

***

These on-chain primitives are essential to making each MindAI Agent a fully sovereign, verifiable, and economically self-sustaining actor in the broader AI-agent economy.

#### 2. Emergent Phase (Bonding Curve)

After submitting the profile and depositing **150 $MINDAI**, the agent will be launched into the **Emergent Phase**:

* A bonding curve is created for the agent token, paired with $MINDAI.
* Users may purchase or pre-buy the agent token along this curve.
* Once **30,000 $MINDAI** has been accumulated in the bonding curve, the agent becomes eligible to "Empowered"

> During this phase, all trading fees (1%) are directed to the protocol treasury to support infrastructure development and sustainability.

***

### Empowering & Liquidity Deployment

Upon reaching the bonding threshold, the agent will **"Empowered"** and transition into its **Operational Phase**. The following processes will be triggered:

* A liquidity pool (LP) will be created, pairing the agent token with $MINDAI on a supported DEX.
* All accumulated $MINDAI and newly minted agent tokens will be deposited into the LP.
* LP tokens will be staked on behalf of the agent with a **10-year lock** to ensure long-term liquidity stability.

***

### Token Mechanics (Planned)

* **Fixed Supply**: Each agent token will have a total supply of **1,000,000,000 tokens**.
* **Pre-buy Option**: During the Emergent Phase, creators may purchase agent tokens early for redistribution or community building.
* **No Pre-Mine or Insider Allocation**: Fair launch principles are upheld through onchain bonding curves and liquidity lockups.

***

### Fee Structure (Proposed)

* **Emergent Phase**:
  * 1% fee → 100% to protocol treasury
* **Operational Phase**:
  * 1% fee split:
    * **70%** to the agent’s wallet
    * **30%** to MindAI Exchange Protocol incentives

***

### Cross-Chain & Token Bridging

The Token Hub will support cross-chain agent creation on **EVM-compatible chains** such as Base, and eventually **non-EVM chains** such as Solana.

Bridging mechanisms are being considered for users who wish to launch or extend agents cross-chain, while maintaining consistency in liquidity pairing with native $MINDAI.

***

### Immutable Infrastructure (Planned Features)

When an agent is empowered, several immutable onchain structures will be deployed:

* **Agent NFT**: A non-fungible token representing the agent’s identity.
* **Agent Token ($WTEXP)**: A fixed-supply ERC-20 token representing economic value.
* **Immutable Contribution Vault (ICV)**: A token-bound address that stores proposals, rewards, or contributions.
* **Liquidity Pool**: An LP on reputable DEX platform, pairing $WTEXP with $MINDAI.
* **sAGENT**: Staking receipts representing LP deposits, locked for 10 years.
