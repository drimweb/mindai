# MindAI Token Hub

## Overview

The **MindAI Token Hub** enables creators to launch autonomous AI agents or agent-powered businesses by locking a set amount of `$MINDAI` tokens. These tokens are used to establish liquidity pools for the agent’s native token—laying the foundation for open, fair, and sustainable economic activity.

This platform empowers agents to operate as self-contained economic entities with permissionless access to capital formation, staking, and participation incentives.

***

### How It Works

#### 🔹 Token Creation

A creator initiates the launch of a new AI agent on the MindAI platform.

#### 🔹 Bonding Curve Setup

To initiate tokenization, the creator deposits **150 `$MINDAI` tokens**, which triggers the deployment of a **bonding curve**. This curve is used to issue the agent's native token, paired with `$MINDAI`.

#### 🔹 Liquidity Pool Creation

Once the bonding curve accumulates **30,000`$MINDAI`**, the agent is considered to be "empowered." At this point, a **liquidity pool** is automatically created—pairing the agent’s token with `$MINDAI`.

This process upholds **fair launch principles**, with no insider allocations or pre-mined tokens.

#### 🔒 Liquidity Lock

To ensure long-term commitment and stability, the liquidity pool is **locked for ten years**.

***

### Fair Launch Principles

* **No Pre-Mine or Insider Allocation**\
  All agent tokens are added directly to the liquidity pool, providing a level playing field for all participants.
* **Fixed Token Supply**\
  Each agent token has a fixed total supply of **1 billion tokens**, guaranteeing predictability and transparency.
* **Long-Term Liquidity Lock**\
  Liquidity is locked for a full decade to support economic stability and trust in the ecosystem.

***

### Trading Fees & Sustainability

All trades involving agent tokens incur a **1% tax**, designed to support the financial sustainability of the agents and businesses over time.

These fees fund critical operational needs such as:

* Model inference costs
* GPU usage
* Ongoing agent development

This approach ensures that agents are incentivized sustainably, without compromising on the principles of fair token distribution.

#### 🧾 Fee Allocation Breakdown

* **Pre-Empowerment (Emergent Agents)**\
  100% of the 1% tax goes to the **protocol treasury**, supporting early-stage ecosystem growth.
* **Post-Empowerment (Operational Agents)**
  * **70%** is directed to the **agent creator’s wallet**
  * **30%** is allocated to **MindAI Trust Protocol incentives**

### ⚙️ Key Launch Parameters

The following table outlines the core parameters for agent tokenization within the MindAI Token Hub. These values define how agent tokens are created, distributed, and bonded prior to entering the Operational Phase.

| Parameter                         | Value          | Purpose                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Agent Creation Deposit    | 150 $MINDAI    | Upfront cost to deploy a new agent and initiate its bonding curve             |
| Bonding Threshold for Empowerment | 30,000 $MINDAI | Total bonded value required for the agent to awaken and enter liquidity phase |
| Token Supply per Agent            | 1,000,000,000  | Defines the fixed supply for each agent token                                 |
| Max Pre-Bonding Token Access      | 87.5%          | Percentage of supply available during bonding curve phase                     |
| Liquidity Lock Duration           | 10 years       | Ensures long-term liquidity stability and trustless commitment                |
| Trading Fee                       | 1%             | Sustains ecosystem; split between protocol and creators post-awakening        |

### 📊 Estimate of the $MINDAI Required to Purchase x% of the Supply During Token Deployment

| Amount of $MINDAI | Supply Accessed (approx.) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1,000             | 12.5%                     |
| 2,500             | 25%                       |
| 4,500             | 37.5%                     |
| 6,000             | 45%                       |
| 9,000             | 60%                       |
| 18,000            | 75%                       |
| 30,000            | 87.5% (Empowerment)       |

> Once the bonding curve accumulates **30,000 $MINDAI**, the agent is considered **empowered and change from Emerging to Operational.  A** liquidity pool will be deployed automatically. The remaining 12.5% of the token supply will become available via the open market.
